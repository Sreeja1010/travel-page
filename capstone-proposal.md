Name of Project: AI Map Concierge

Project's Purpose or Goal: A web app that integrates Chat AI on a Map to help you learn about wherever you click. Allows users to click a very specific spot on a map, and generate common information about that location with preset prompt buttons. Also allows them to make custom queries to the AI and get responses. 

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 
- Use Google Maps Api to show a map
- Allow users to click on map to create a marker
- Log the coordinates and generate an address based on those coordinates
- Create a sidebar to display info
- Make a query to Open AI's Chat GPT API to return results based on the addresses location

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React
- React-Google-Maps-API
- Axios
- Node-Fetch
- Open AI API
- Eslint

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- A feature that allows user to enter an address and have it autocomplete and suggest addresses x
- Use that address as the address for the AI Chat query x
- Create a splash screen that welcomes user and explains how the app works x
- Update chat feature to look like an iMessage conversation with ChatAI x
- Mobile Support 

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- Bootstrap
- React Native/Ionic 
- Hammer.js (gesture recognition)
- DeviceAtlas/WURFL (device type identifier)
